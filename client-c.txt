Task: You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

1. Value is 1 scan equals 2 boxes
2. Limit is 50 boxes per 1 case
	case value=25 scans
3.Every 25 scans loop resets print file
4.Print file equals 1 integer every 2 scan
	Limit is 25 scan before loop resets
5.Print function is x=2
	x= "text" 2
	x+1= "text" 4
		Repeat until x=25
6.Reset print text
7.case has reached maximum.
8.Reset to x=2 and begin new case
